# Clue: Prescription Note

## Name
Prescription Note

## Type
evidence

## Brief Description
A medical prescription slip for digitalis.

## Detailed Description
A prescription slip from Dr. Elizabeth Chen's pad, found crumpled near the kitchen bin. It's made out to Lord Blackwood for digitalis heart medication, dated one month ago. However, Dr. Chen confirms she only wrote one prescription, which was filled. This is a second slip - someone tore it from her pad and wrote a matching prescription, perhaps to acquire more medication from a different pharmacy or to explain having the poison in their possession if caught.

## Significance
This proves the killer planned the murder and had access to Dr. Chen's medical bag. It wasn't a crime of passion - it was premeditated.
