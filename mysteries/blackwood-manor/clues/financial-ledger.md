## Brief Description
A hidden accounting ledger showing irregular company finances.

## Detailed Description
A leather-bound ledger discovered in a hidden compartment in the library bookshelf. It contains detailed records of the Blackwood-Hartley Shipping Company finances. The entries show systematic discrepancies: money withdrawn but not accounted for, payments to fictitious vendors, and a pattern of small thefts adding up to over £15,000 over three years. Notes in James Hartley's handwriting attempt to hide the irregularities.

## Significance
This is the motive for murder. James Hartley was embezzling from the company. If Lord Blackwood exposed him, Hartley would face prison and financial ruin. This gave him reason to kill.
