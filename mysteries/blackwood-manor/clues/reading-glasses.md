# Clue: Reading Glasses

## Name
Lady Margaret's Reading Glasses

## Type
evidence

## Brief Description
A pair of elegant reading glasses found on the floor of the study, near the desk.

## Detailed Description
Silver-framed reading glasses with a delicate chain, found on the study floor near Lord Blackwood's desk. The glasses are clearly feminine in style - small, elegant frames that would belong to a woman. They match the pair Lady Margaret is often seen wearing when reading in the library. One lens has a small smudge, as if they were dropped hastily.

Lady Margaret claims she was in the library reading all evening. But her reading glasses are here, in the study. She couldn't have been reading without them.

## Significance
This proves Lady Margaret was in the study at some point during the evening, despite her claim that she was in the library the whole time. Why would she lie about being in the study? This makes her look very suspicious - but it doesn't prove she committed the murder.
