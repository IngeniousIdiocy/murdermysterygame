## Brief Description
A legal contract between Blackwood and Hartley for their shipping company.

## Detailed Description
A formal business contract found in Lord Blackwood's study, dated three years ago, establishing the Blackwood-Hartley Shipping Company. The margins are filled with angry handwritten notes in Lord Blackwood's hand: "Check these figures!", "Where did this money go?", and most damning, "EMBEZZLEMENT???"

## Significance
This proves Lord Blackwood was suspicious of James Hartley's financial dealings. The annotations suggest he had discovered something wrong with the company accounts.
