# Clue: Poison Bottle

## Name
Poison Bottle

## Type
evidence

## Brief Description
A small medicine bottle containing digitalis, hidden in the kitchen pantry.

## Detailed Description
A small brown glass bottle with a pharmacy label reading "Digitalis - Heart Medication" from Whitmore's Pharmacy. Found hidden behind jars in the kitchen pantry. The prescription label shows it was prescribed to Lord Blackwood by Dr. Chen, dated one month ago. The bottle should be mostly full but is nearly empty - far more medication is missing than Lord Blackwood would have taken therapeutically.

## Significance
This is the murder weapon. Digitalis in high doses causes cardiac arrest. Someone took the medication and used it to poison Lord Blackwood's brandy. The killer hid the evidence in the pantry, probably planning to dispose of it later.
