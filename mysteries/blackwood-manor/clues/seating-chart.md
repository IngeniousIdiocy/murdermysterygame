## Brief Description
A handwritten diagram showing the dinner seating arrangement.

## Detailed Description
A small card in elegant handwriting showing the planned seating for the dinner party. Lord Blackwood sat at the head of the table. James Hartley was seated directly to his right - close enough to observe when Blackwood excused himself and where he was going. Lady Margaret sat at the opposite end. Victoria was strategically placed far from both Margaret and Richard to avoid tension.

## Significance
This shows that James Hartley had the best opportunity to notice when Lord Blackwood left for the study and to slip away himself shortly after.

## Placeholder Image Description
