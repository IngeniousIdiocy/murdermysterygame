# Clue: Muddy Footprints

## Name
Muddy Footprints

## Type
evidence

## Brief Description
Fresh footprints in the mud leading from the study window to the garden gate.

## Detailed Description
A trail of muddy footprints on the stone garden path, clearly made tonight (the rain stopped at 6 PM). They lead from beneath the study window toward the garden gate, then back again. The prints are from men's dress shoes, size 10 based on the clear impressions. The stride length suggests someone of medium height, around 5'10". The return prints are deeper and more hurried - someone walking quickly, almost running.

Notably, these are clearly men's shoes - a woman's heel pattern would be distinctly different. Thomas Reed, the butler, wears size 12 (his shoes are visible in the kitchen). That leaves only James Hartley and the deceased Lord Blackwood as men of similar build who would wear size 10.

## Significance
Someone went from the garden to the study window and back, during the critical time window. The shoe size and build eliminate the women and the butler. Combined with other evidence, this could place a specific suspect at the scene.
