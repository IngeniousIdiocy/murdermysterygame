# Clue: Spilled Brandy Stain

## Name
Dried Brandy Stain

## Type
evidence

## Brief Description
A dried brandy stain on the carpet near the desk, separate from the glass on the desk.

## Detailed Description
A dried amber stain on the Persian rug, approximately two feet from where the brandy glass sits on the desk. The stain pattern suggests a glass was knocked over and spilled, then cleaned up hastily - but not well enough to remove the mark entirely. The current glass on the desk is half-full and upright.

This suggests the brandy glass was knocked over at some point, then either picked up and refilled, or replaced with a new glass. Someone spilled this brandy before the one that poisoned Lord Blackwood was poured.

## Significance
This indicates there may have been a physical confrontation or struggle in the study before the murder. Combined with other evidence, it suggests someone was in the study earlier who knocked things over. The murderer then came later and prepared the poisoned brandy in a fresh or refilled glass.
