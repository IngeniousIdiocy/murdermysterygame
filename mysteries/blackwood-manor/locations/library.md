# Location: The Library

## Description
A warm, intimate room with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and comfortable leather reading chairs arranged near a crackling fireplace. Unlike the study, this room feels lived-in and welcoming. This was Lady Margaret's favorite retreat.

## Atmosphere
The fire still burns low, casting dancing shadows on the walls. A half-read book lies open on a side table - evidence of Lady Margaret's interrupted evening. The room smells of leather, old paper, and woodsmoke.

## Notable Features
- Extensive collection of books (fiction, history, philosophy)
- Comfortable leather armchairs by the fireplace
- Reading lamp and side tables
- Lady Margaret's abandoned book and reading glasses
- Hidden compartment behind some books (discovered during investigation)
- Writing desk in the corner with correspondence

## Evidence Note
Lady Margaret claims she was here during the murder. The room may hold clues to her truthfulness or reveal hidden secrets.
