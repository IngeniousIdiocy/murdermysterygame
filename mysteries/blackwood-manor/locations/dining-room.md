# Location: The Dining Room

## Description
An elegant formal dining room with a long mahogany table set for eight. Fine china, crystal glasses, and silver cutlery gleam in the candlelight. The meal was interrupted by the discovery of the body, and plates of half-eaten food remain.

## Atmosphere
The interrupted dinner tells a story of sudden tragedy. Wine glasses still contain dregs of red wine. Napkins are thrown haphazardly. The candles have burned low. What should have been an elegant evening ended in horror.

## Notable Features

## Evidence Note
