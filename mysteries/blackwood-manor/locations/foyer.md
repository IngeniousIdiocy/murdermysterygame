# Location: Grand Foyer

## Description
An impressive entrance hall with soaring ceilings and a sweeping marble staircase. A crystal chandelier casts warm light across the space. Portraits of Blackwood ancestors line the walls, their painted eyes seeming to follow visitors.

The foyer feels grand but cold tonight. The usual welcoming warmth is gone, replaced by tension and suspicion. Guests mill about uncertainly, speaking in hushed tones.
