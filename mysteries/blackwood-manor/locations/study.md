# Location: The Study

## Description
A dark wood-paneled room dominated by a massive mahogany desk. Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the walls, filled with leather-bound volumes. The air smells faintly of tobacco and old books. A Persian rug covers most of the hardwood floor. This is where Lord Blackwood's body was discovered.

## Atmosphere
The room feels heavy with tragedy. Papers are scattered across the desk, disturbed during the investigation. A crystal decanter of brandy sits half-empty on a silver tray. The body has been removed, but a chalk outline remains on the rug.
