# Location: The Garden

## Description
A moonlit garden with manicured hedges, rose bushes, and stone pathways. A wrought-iron gate leads to the road beyond the estate. The study window is visible from here, its curtains now drawn.

## Atmosphere
The autumn night is cold and damp. Recent rain has left the ground muddy in places. The moon occasionally breaks through the clouds, illuminating the garden in silver light. An owl hoots in the distance.
